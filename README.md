## Project Overview

This CI/CD automation tool simplifies the setup of CI/CD pipelines by automating workflow generation. It guides users through a selection process to create customized workflows based on their project requirements.

## Installation

To install the CI/CD automation tool, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CI-CD-automation-tool.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd CI-CD-automation-tool

# Install the required dependencies
npm install
```

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine. You can check if it's installed by running:

```bash
node -v
```

If not installed, download and install it from the official website.

## Usage

To generate a CI/CD workflow, use the following command:

```bash
node ci-tool/index.js init
```

### Steps for generating workflows:

1.  **Run the tool**: After running the above command, the tool will prompt you to select the technology stack.
2.  **Select options**: Depending on the stack selected (e.g., Node.js, React, Python), you will be asked to choose different configuration options such as:

    - Package manager (npm or yarn)
    - Version of Node.js
    - Working directory for your project

3.  **Create the workflow**: Based on your responses, the tool will generate the appropriate configuration file for the selected stack.

### Example Usage:

```bash
$ node ci-tool/index.js init
? Select your environment: Node.js
? Select a package manager: npm
? Enter the Node version: 14
? Enter the working directory for your Node project: app
